1
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:15,141
Free software is the first battle

2
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:18,162
in the liberation of cyberspace.

3
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:20,223
Who controls your computer?

4
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:25,678
Is it you or is it some big company
that's really controlling it?

5
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,786
What is a computer?

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,858
A computer is a universal machine.

7
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:35,125
It will do any computation you want it to

8
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,405
because you give it a program that says

9
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,167
what the computation is that you want.

10
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:43,982
The computer only knows
how to get out an instruction and do it,

11
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:46,358
and get out another
instruction and do it.

12
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:50,557
The program has the instructions,
it says what to do.

13
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:55,252
By writing the right program,
you can make it do anything.

14
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:57,665
Well, almost anything.

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,698
Who gives the instructions
to your computer?

16
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,327
You might think it's
obeying your instructions

17
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,495
when really it's obeying
somebody else first,

18
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:13,953
and you only as much as
that company will let it listen to you.

19
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,049
With software,
there are two possibilities:

20
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:21,491
Either the users control the program,
or the program controls the users.

21
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:23,842
It's inevitably one or the other.

22
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:27,092
In order for the users
to control the program,

23
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:30,920
they need the four essential freedoms.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,404
That's the definition of free software.

25
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:38,355
Free software respects
the user's freedom and community.

26
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:42,394
Now, we often call it "Libre"
using the French or Spanish word.

27
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:45,716
Pronounce it as you like,
the point is that's what we mean.

28
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:48,798
We don't mean it's gratis,
we're not talking about price.

29
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,038
We're concerned with your freedom,

30
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:55,554
and we sometimes say
"Free/Libre" to show that.

31
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:58,476
Freedom zero is the freedom
to run the program

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,239
as you wish for whatever purpose.

33
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:05,357
Freedom one is the freedom to study
the source code of the program

34
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:09,717
and change it, so it does
the computing you want it to do.

35
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:11,449
But what is the source code?

36
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,576
Every program typically
will have two forms.

37
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,390
There's the form that you can read,
and you can understand

38
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:20,485
if you know the programming language.

39
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:21,929
That's the source.

40
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:24,321
That's what programmers write and change.

41
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:27,222
Then, there's the executable,
which is a bunch of numbers

42
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:29,583
which even a programmer can't figure out.

43
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:31,583
If all you get is the executable,

44
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:34,982
it's a horrible pain in the neck
to the figure out what it does,

45
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,866
and even harder to change it.

46
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,069
So, to give you the real possibility
to study and change it,

47
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,941
they've got to give you the source code.

48
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,621
That's a requirement.

49
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,453
With those two freedoms,

50
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:50,301
each user separately can make a copy

51
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:54,091
and start changing it
and make it do what she wants.

52
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:56,746
That's individual control.

53
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:58,914
But what if you're not a programmer?

54
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:01,703
You look at the source code,
and you don't understand it.

55
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:04,783
Individual control isn't enough.

56
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:06,962
We also need collective control,

57
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:10,363
which means any group of users
are free to work together

58
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,914
to adapt the program to what they want.

59
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:16,026
Of course, in the group,
some of them are programmers.

60
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,721
They're the ones who
actually write the changes,

61
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,839
but they're doing it as part of the group

62
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,608
for what the group wants.

63
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:25,388
Of course, the group
doesn't have to be everybody.

64
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,586
Others can use it some other way.

65
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:30,131
They're all free to do that.

66
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:33,501
Collective control requires
two more essential freedoms.

67
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,976
Freedom two is the freedom
to redistribute exact copies,

68
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:38,927
to make the copies and then give them away

69
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:41,026
or sell them when you wish.

70
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,012
Freedom three is similar,

71
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:45,276
but it's for your modified versions.

72
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,172
You're free to make copies, and then
give them or sell them when you wish.

73
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,202
If you do have these freedoms,
then it's free software,

74
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:54,093
the users control the program.

75
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,785
But if any of those freedoms is missing,

76
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,537
then the users don't control the program.

77
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:05,580
Instead, the program controls the users
and the developer controls the program.

78
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:10,632
So, that means this program
is an instrument of unjust power

79
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,539
for its developer over the users.

80
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:17,500
That means the users don't have freedom,

81
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,797
that's nonâ€‘free, proprietary software
which we've got to get rid of.

82
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:25,262
When you've got proprietary software,
what happens?

83
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:29,102
Sometimes, the program snoops on the user.

84
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:32,219
Sometimes, it tracks the user.

85
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:35,235
Sometimes, it restricts the user,

86
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:38,178
and stops users from doing
what they want to do.

87
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,297
You can see that the blue ray
is your enemy.

88
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,347
[Laughter]

89
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,994
Sometimes, the software
remotely deletes books

90
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:49,115
as Amazon did with "Nineteen Eighty-Four".

91
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,764
Sometimes, the developer compels users

92
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:58,405
to install a harmful upgrade,

93
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:01,529
by threatening to take away
other functionality

94
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:04,668
if it's not installed, as Sony did.

95
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,443
Sometimes, they can even forcibly change
the software at a distance

96
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:14,631
as Microsoft can with Windows
through the universal back door.

97
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:18,175
Sometimes, they even sabotage users,

98
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:23,370
as Microsoft does when it tells
the NSA about bugs in Windows,

99
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:26,673
so it can use them
to attack people's computers.

100
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:30,751
What you get is basically,
with proprietary software,

101
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:33,795
the owner has power over the users,

102
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:36,034
and takes advantage of this power,

103
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,906
putting in those various
malicious functionalities

104
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:41,937
to hurt the users.

105
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:44,916
Of course, they don't do this
because they're sadists;

106
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,719
they're doing it just
for money, for greed.

107
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:51,111
They have various ways
that they can profit

108
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:53,759
from having this power over users,

109
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:58,355
which does not make it
even the tiniest bit less evil.

110
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,253
But they have no shame about it.

111
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,010
They have conferences where
they talk about the latest ways

112
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,374
they can take advantage of users
through the power they have.

113
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:11,077
Basically, proprietary software,

114
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:15,823
which is now for almost all of the users
of proprietary software,

115
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,595
they're using proprietary malware.

116
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:21,020
It's "software for suckers".

117
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,812
How do you stop being the victim?

118
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:28,931
Formerly, you had to stop using computers,
but not anymore.

119
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:34,265
Now, you can come join us
in the free world that we've built.

120
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,120
In 1983, I announced I would develop

121
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:41,821
a completely free software
operating system called GNU.

122
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:45,415
In 1992, we had it almost finished,

123
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,179
but one piece was missing, the kernel.

124
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,546
Linus Torvalds, in that year,
freed his kernel, Linux,

125
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,188
which filled the last gap,
and gave us

126
00:06:55,195 --> 00:07:00,045
the first complete system
you could run on a PC: GNU/Linux.

127
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:07,403
Unfortunately, having freedom at one point
doesn't guarantee you'll keep it.

128
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:11,408
There are over a thousand
different variants of GNU/Linux.

129
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,418
They're called distributions.

130
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,279
A few of them are entirely free software;

131
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,959
most of them have nonâ€‘free software added,

132
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,584
because they're maintained by people
who aren't concerned about freedom.

133
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,860
They'd rather add convenience --
but at the cost of freedom.

134
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,969
So you have to check
which is a free distro.

135
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,753
To keep your freedom,
sometimes requires a sacrifice,

136
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:37,728
sometimes a big sacrifice,
as at Lexington.

137
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,959
But in our campaign,
they tend to be little sacrifices.

138
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:48,337
Anybody with a little bit of maturity
can make these sacrifices.

139
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:52,681
For instance, you want applications,
but some of them are nonâ€‘free.

140
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,398
If you want freedom,
you've got to do without them.

141
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:58,063
There may be some inconveniences

142
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,324
you have to suffer
for your freedom's sake.

143
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:05,851
Then, many websites
send nonâ€‘free programs,

144
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:09,174
written in JavaScript,
to the user's browser.

145
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:11,422
If you don't want
to run nonâ€‘free programs,

146
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:13,878
you should install LibreJS

147
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,571
which blocks, keeps out,
nonâ€‘free JavaScript.

148
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:21,902
Sometimes, servers will offer
to do your computing.

149
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,254
They say, "Send us all your data."

150
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,099
Obviously, for suckers.

151
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:30,211
Then the server does the computing,
and sends you back the results.

152
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:32,866
But you're not supposed
to think about what's happening,

153
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:37,537
because it's a "cloud",
and you don't see what's going on.

154
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,188
Well, you should look.

155
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:42,486
It's service as a software substitute,

156
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,303
and it takes away control
of your computing.

157
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:50,037
A large fraction of
the world's web servers

158
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,139
are running GNU/Linux
and other free software.

159
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:56,984
But I think the most important
computers to put freedom in

160
00:08:57,012 --> 00:09:00,768
are your computers,
not companies' web servers.

161
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,612
They deserve freedom, also.

162
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,943
But above all, it's people
that deserve freedom.

163
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:08,879
So we need to advance,

164
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,294
and to do that,
we have to cross obstacles.

165
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,547
One of them is there are big companies

166
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,641
that make a lot of money
by having control over users.

167
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:19,875
They don't want to let us advance.

168
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,850
We have to overcome their opposition.

169
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,280
Another is that the mainstream media
don't talk about free software.

170
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:32,359
They have a term that they use
to bury these ethical issues.

171
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:35,238
They say "open source" instead.

172
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:39,459
Now, it talks about more
or less the same programs,

173
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:41,396
but with different ideas.

174
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,655
Where free software activists say,

175
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,587
"This is a matter of right and wrong.

176
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,857
Users deserve freedom.
We demand freedom."

177
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:50,757
The people who say open source,
they don't want to say that.

178
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:52,176
Instead, they say,

179
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,778
"Let the users change
the software and redistribute it,

180
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,629
and they'll make the code better.

181
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,161
They'll fix some bugs."

182
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,427
It may be true, but it's
a less important issue.

183
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:04,709
If we want to keep our freedom,
we've got to talk about freedom.

184
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:08,327
So say, "free software,"
and you're helping us every time.

185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,688
Another obstacle is that lots
of schools teach nonâ€‘free software,

186
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,242
which is basically like teaching
the kids to smoke tobacco.

187
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:18,226
It's implanting dependence,

188
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,560
which is the opposite
of what schools should do.

189
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:24,571
A school should prepare citizens to live

190
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:30,903
in a strong, capable, independent,
cooperating and free society,

191
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:34,553
which means, teaching
free software in the school.

192
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:37,466
But there's another reason
to do that for education.

193
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:40,776
Some kids want to become programmers,
they're curious.

194
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,662
They want to know how the programs work.

195
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:45,671
While the one who's studying
a free software can understand it,

196
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:49,432
the one who's studying a nonâ€‘free
program can't learn anything,

197
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,194
because the knowledge
in the nonâ€‘free program

198
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:56,493
is withheld, denied to the students.

199
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:58,827
So to uphold the spirit of education,

200
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,385
the school should make sure
its programs are free.

201
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:04,284
But there's an even
more important reason:

202
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,170
Schools should teach
the spirit of goodwill,

203
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:09,329
the habit of helping other people.

204
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:11,120
The class should say,

205
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,443
"If you bring a program to class,

206
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,838
just as if you bring cookies to class,

207
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:17,873
you've got to share it with everyone else.

208
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,563
You can't keep it to yourself.

209
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:23,689
You've got to share the source code,
so other people can learn.

210
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:27,090
So don't bring any proprietary software
to this class."

211
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,899
The school has to set a good example
by following its own rule:

212
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:34,562
You should bring only
free software to class,

213
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:39,291
except as a reverse engineering exercise.

214
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,924
Another obstacle is there's hardware

215
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:44,681
we don't know how
to write free software for,

216
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:47,467
because they won't tell us
how to use the hardware.

217
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:50,202
That's shocking.
They want to sell you the product,

218
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,295
and they won't tell you how to use it.

219
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:55,781
They say, "Here's a
nonâ€‘free program you can use.

220
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:59,248
Run it, and shut up.
Don't bother us."

221
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,905
How do we find out how to run
that hardware with reverse engineering?

222
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:08,559
You've got to study all those 0's and 1's
to figure out what they really do,

223
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,390
and write down how to use that hardware,

224
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,379
so someone else can write
the free program to do it.

225
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,693
It's hard work, but it can be done --

226
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,282
if you want to make
a big technical contribution,

227
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,247
that's what you should do.

228
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,659
Each new area, activity of life,

229
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:28,867
can bring with it new human rights
that are necessary.

230
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:31,302
The human rights depend on each other.

231
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,769
If you lose one,

232
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,550
it becomes harder
to maintain the others.

233
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:39,773
So, nowadays, computing is
so important in society

234
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:44,059
that the freedoms of free software
are among the human rights

235
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:47,177
that society must establish and protect.

236
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:49,637
Thus, how to help?

237
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:51,677
You can write free software.

238
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:54,469
You can organize groups to campaign,

239
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:58,157
and persuade schools and governments
to move to free software.

240
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:01,798
You can help other people when
they have trouble using free software,

241
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,687
or help them install it.

242
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:08,375
You can say, "free software,"
and spread the philosophical ideas.

243
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,279
Moving to free software is the first step
in the liberation of cyberspace,

244
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:15,408
but of course, we also use the Internet.

245
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,031
We need other freedoms there,

246
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,729
like network neutrality,
and putting an end

247
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:24,478
to surveillance of people in general.

248
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,295
(Applause)
