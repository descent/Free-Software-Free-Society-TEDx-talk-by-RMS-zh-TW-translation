Free software, free society: Richard Stallman at TEDxGeneva 2014

It is the first TEDx talk of the pope of Free Culture. Richard M. Stallman, RMS for short, has changed the world with his vision of freedom at digital age. He launched the movement for free/libre software. The GNU operating system, used with Linux as a component, is the result of this campaign. Stallman's work inspired Creative Commons and Wikipedia.

In this talk, Stallman describes what he does in order to recover control over computing, both within computers and across the Internet network.

This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences.
